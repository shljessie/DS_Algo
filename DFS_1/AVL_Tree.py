"""
AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree
in which each node maintains extra information called 
a balance factor whose value is either -1, 0 or +1.

Balance factor (L_subtree - R_subtree  or  R_subtree - L_subtree)
 of a node in an AVL tree is the difference between
  the height of the left subtree and that of the right subtree
   of that node.
