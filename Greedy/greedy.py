"""
A greedy algorithm is an approach for solving a problem by selecting the best
option available at the moment. It doesn't worry whether the current best 
result will bring the overall optimal result.

The algorithm never reverses the earlier decision even if the choice is wrong.
 It works in a top-down approach.

Two properties when you use the Greedy Algorithm
1. Greedy Choice Property 
If an optimal solution to the problem can be found by choosing the best choice 
at each step without reconsidering the previous steps once chosen, the problem can be solved using a greedy approach. This property is called greedy choice property.

2. Optimal Substructure
If the optimal overall solution to the problem corresponds to the optimal solution to its subproblems,
