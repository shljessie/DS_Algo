- Binary Tree  
- Full Binary Tree : Every Parent has two or no children
- Perfect Binary Tree : Every node has two children and are at same level
- Complete Binary Tree : All levels are filled and lean to the left
- Balanced Binary Tree : A balanced binary tree, also referred to as a height-balanced binary tree, is defined as a binary tree in which the height of the left and right subtree of any node differ by not more than 1.
- Binary Search Tree : smaller to left, larger to right. Insert and Deletion (Olog(n) time)
- AVL Tree
